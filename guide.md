### Introduction to CS
-------------------------------
This section contains the starter pack to understanding Computer Science.
One obviously needs an introduction to the field before picking up an interest.
Sometimes it takes people an year of exploration before they can pick a field of
their choice and it is genuine because everything seems to be gold at the start,
right? I am putting so much emphasis on this section because this may be the most
crucial part of this whole journey, _trying to pick something to work upon_.

- **[Map of Computer Science](https://youtu.be/SzJ46YA_RaA)**: A detailed video(sort of?) on CS and its disciplines. A must watch
- **Harvard's CS50(please add a working link here)**: A really good and highly recommended course on introduction to CS. It      also provides a hands-on to the student.



### Cryptography
-------------------------------
**Art of the Problem**: YT Channel
**Learn Crypto**: Free course on Coursera by Dan Boneh
**crypto101.io**: Free crypto manual and course




### Computer and Wireless Networks
-------------------------------
- **Computer Networks: A Top-down approach; Kurose & Ross**: A must read book on Computer networks.
- **[NPTEL course on Computer Networks](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106105081/#) by Prof. Sujoy Ghosh**: A good and detailed course on computer networks.
- To explore modern cellular networks, reading research papers would be a good start :)

### Competitive Coding
-------------------------------
<p align="justify">
To start with Competitive Programming there are a few prerequisites. It is highly advisable to first start with these basics(if you have not yet done so) and only then move forward. These include:</br>
•	Get familiar with at least one programming language. C++ is highly advisable followed by python. Though you may choose any other language too.</br>
•	Understand the needs and implementations of different data structures in the language. For example, in C++ checkout the STL, vectors, maps, sets, lists, stacks, queues etc.</br>

After this, you should start with the basic problems, the ones having higher acceptance ratio or the ones with many correct submissions, and then move on to tougher problems slowly. It is very necessary to find the best approach for the problem. Don’t get a habit to just submit a working code and then move on to the next problem. Try to analyse your solution and enhance its time and space complexities. Also try to implement any pre-existing algorithm and do not just find brute-force solutions.

To learn new algorithms, the ‘Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS’ is a very good book. Read the topics that you are willing to learn or need to learn, completely. Try not to skip sub-sections from it and clear any doubts you have. Another source can be http://cp-algorithms.com/. It is a good collection of several important algorithms and their pseudo-code implementations.

Also, try to focus on one topic at a time in the beginning. For example, if you read about Dynamic Programming, try to solve a few problems on it to get a better understanding of the topic, before moving further. You can read about its different variations and what are its main uses on the go.

Do not neglect some topics that you consider are trivial. If you have not read the topics formally but have rough ideas about it, you should at least give it a reading. For example, you may have some ideas about Number Theory or Game Theory, but might not know some theorems relating to it, which are in general quite useful. Nevertheless, this can be skipped if you feel confident about the topic.

The platforms that are highly advisable include:   
•	Codeforces   
•	Spoj   
•	Hackerrank   
•	Codechef   

In the beginning focus on learning concepts and not improving your contest ratings. This is very helpful and in fact necessary. If you have weak concepts, it may create a huge problem in the longer run. Refrain from focusing on quantity of knowledge over quality.

These are just a few things to keep in mind as a beginner. You will be able to figure out other things as you move on. All the best! Cheers.
