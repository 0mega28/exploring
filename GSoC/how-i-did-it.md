# How I prepared for GSoC

I started the prep in mid January (which is relatively early I know but I had my own reasons which I am willing to share in-person). My main focus was on Git, but I did keep a list of potential orgs like I mentioned before. I first [completed](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200118083326.9643-5-shouryashukla.oo@gmail.com/) the Git [microproject](https://git.github.io/General-Microproject-Information/) which is a pre-requisite for any potential GSoC/Outreachy student.

Due to some internal circumstances at Git, the chances of them appearing for GSoC seemed very low. Hence, I decided to keep CGAL as backup and did a couple of assignments assigned to me by my mentor. Yes, it is a bit hectic to manage two organisations, but it is not impossible. I was also doing my research project at that time (which has now resulted in a publication in IEEE VTC 2021 Spring). I will cover the stuff I did for CGAL and Git below.

## CGAL

For CGAL, I was working on a couple of assignments given to me by a mentor there. The assignments involved playing around with polygons and displaying their faces in various given possible ways. I also had to make some modifications here and there. I was honestly a bit intimidated by the assignment, maybe because it was the first time I was doing a thing like this. I was in touch with the mentor till about late February but lost my enthusiasm for CGAL long before that.

## Git

After completing the aforementioned microproject, I got onto discussing prospective projects with the people at Git. I did face many difficulties in deciding what to do mostly because of the fact that it was difficult to understand what the project demanded. I had to read a lot of codes to understand how things worked; figure out the patterns in the code; make notes of the important catch points. After many discussions I landed on the project `Convert submodule to a builtin`. While reading code, I also tried to comment on other peoples' patches and also solve queries of many others. Why? Because I like helping others and it was giving me more idea about many things about Git. This did give me a bit of an edge while shortlisting (that's what my mentor told me).

I designed my project timeline in a unique way by working not just after the selection but even after the proposal submission deadline up until the results were announced irrespective of if I was selected or not. I was quite (and still am) passionate about Git and maybe that's why I wanted to work irrespective of my result. You don't have to be like me if you don't want to. This does not affect if you are selected or not.

It was exerting, to be honest, the whole process since I had not done anything like that ever before, but I guess it was worth it! If I am missing out on anything you'd like to hear, do mention. Bye-Bye!
