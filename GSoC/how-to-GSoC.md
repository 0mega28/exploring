# What is GSoC?

## What is Open Source?

Open source software, in simple words, is software which grants anyone the right to publish, modify and study the software under a License. This means different things for different software: In some, you may not require to credit/mention the author(s) of the software in case you distribute the software under your name/brand, while in some cases you might have to.

Basically, a group of people maintain the software, contributing in some way or the other. And you can freely distribute and modify the software as per your needs. This is the reason why so many distributions of Linux exist (such as Debian, Manjaro, Mint and OpenBSD, to name a few). Anyone is free to contribute this software as per their need without any constraints. Contributions can be anything from writing new programs to changing the Documentation.

## GSoC

GSoC or Google Summer of Code, is a [competition](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) hosted by Google which runs from May to August. The point of this competition is to promote open source culture and try to indulge students into the culture. One does a few contributions into the organisation of their choice and writes a proposal for the project they want to do in the summer as a part of GSoC. The project is reviewed by the mentors and recommends the names of the students to GSoC which in turn selects the students and pays a stipend for the work (around $3000, may change depending on the situation) in a 30-30-40 fashion. Your work is evaluated on a monthly basis and failing any evaluation results in termination of GSoC. You are awarded the money only after passing each evaluation. On passsing all the evaluations, you are eligible for T-shirts and stickers given by Google. **Remember that you are NOT an employee of Google and cannot state the same anywhere.**

There are about 250 organisations which take part in GSoC and around 1200 students are selected across the world (there is no upper bound on the number of selections, but the figure stays around this number generally). These are the stages of GSoC:

	- Community Bonding Period
	- Phase 1
	- Phase 2
	- Phase 3

The competition has great prestige associated with it (especially in Indian colleges). A large number of people are not aware with GSoC but if you explain it to them, you get a "wow" reaction. I did my GSoC for Git in 2020. [This](GSoC-Project-Proposal.pdf) was my proposal. [This](how-i-did-it.md) explains how I went about preparing for GSoC.

# Organisations

As I said above, there are around 250 organisations each year offering a multitude of projects to work upon. There are not only organisations working on new languages like Go, C#, JavaScript, etc., but also on old languages like ASM, shell and C. Therefore, you will surely not fall short of organisations to choose from. Some well known organisations are:

	- CGAL
	- Chapel
	- Checker Framework
	- Dart
	- Django
	- Git
	- Mozilla
	- Oppia
	- Sugar Labs
	- Tensorflow
	- VLC

to name a few. What each organisation does is your research ;)
Also, if an organisation is not "well-known", it does not mean that it will not offer great work. Oppurtunities like GSoC give you a free pass to connect with people working in all sorts of companies in different countries. Keeping healthy relations with people in the organisation can land you great oppurtunities as well.

# How to start preparing for GSoC?

## Choosing an organisation

The first thing is to choose the organisation to work for. There are a couple of things to consider here:

- **What language/framework you want to work on?** Whether you want to stick to something you already know or learn something new. There are some obvious advantages and drawbacks to both the approaches so choose wisely. Remember that this choice can include multiple languages to choose from. For instance, you may want to work in any of Java, C or C++.
- **Filter out the orgs w.r.t. the above choice.** Say you want to work on Go, then obviously look into orgs which are using as their main programming language of choice.
- **Choose according to your interests and the community.** Now that you have a list of organisations, look at the community of the organisations and how things go about. Obviously a couple of chats/mails will not define how the org is but you should get some idea as to how work is done. Try to choose an org with an active community which is friendly to newcomers.

- **If you had a target organisation in mind from the start** based on reviews/interactions with seniors or elsewhere, then go for it.

- **Start contributing to the org.** Close to zero organisations will accept a proposal from someone whose name they are hearing for the first time. Your aim should be to stay as active as possible (**without** compromising other things in your life) on the communication channel the org uses and try to get your proposal reviewed. Please contribute to the org in any way possible, only then will you have an edge over others. But before contributing, keep the point mentioned below in mind.

- **Make sure that the org is registering itself for GSoC.** Many times it happens that the org may not register itself for GSoC due to various reasons and hence any of your contirbutions may not bear fruit in terms of GSoC. Hence, make sure that the org is appearing for GSoC. There are a couple of approaches you can adopt to make sure your work does not go in vain:
	- Contribute to the org only after the list of orgs are announced. This is a very safe option and will require less work.
	- Keep up with contributing to two organisations, given one of them has appeared frequently for GSoC. This option requires a lot of work but this way you can strengthen your chances of selection since you will be contributing for a longer time.

- **If for some reason, the org you were contributing to does not show up** at the end, do NOT panic. Take a day off, calm yourself down and look for any other org. It is still not late. It will take you a couple of days to figure out an org since you will have some idea of the orgs appearing.
- Maintain a list of orgs and useful resources for GSoC. [This](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EDXNxXNmMt2KUI0gP-HAswUk8OoGoYN0AtmOTbmcQ-I/edit?usp=sharing) is what I had maintained during my time. You may not see Git here since I was already making small contributions to there and thought it was pointless to mention it here.

After following the above steps, you should have at least one organisation to work with. In my case, I decided to work on Git and kept CGAL as my backup in case Git did not appear. Though Git appeared for every GSoC except one till date, but the conditions at that time felt as if they may not come that season. Hence, I kept CGAL as my backup and did some work for them too.

There are some orgs which are known to require less amount of work to get shortlisted while some need a lot of work to get in. I will not mention the former kind since it may be an insult to those who actually contributing with all their might and dedication. But those in the latter category (*i.e.*, requiring lots of work) are:

	- Afl++
	- Boost
	- Git
	- OpenCV
	- Oppia
	- TensorFlow
	- The Linux Foundation

I might be missing out on some.

## Contributing

The GSoC website states that contributing to an org is not necessary, but in fact it is. The sooner you start, the better. The first and foremost thing should be to contribute some code to the organisation (or at least try to). To do this, discuss with the contributors at the org as to how you can do so (given that you are a newbie). Apart from this, the other ways you can make a contirbution is by helping people who are facing some problems. You can also make Documentation changes, like correcting spelling errors etc. The more contributions and activity on the chat group/mailing list, the better. Try to start the contributions by mid-February latest (considering the [organisation list](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/organizations/) is declared in March).

Do not forget to introduce yourself to the org. A small intro about who you are and where you study will be enough. Generally, the orgs are newbie friendly though exceptions are not rare. Do not hesitate from asking for help and please be polite to others. No one tolerates nonsense anywhere. There is a 99.99% chance that others will be right. Accept any mistakes you made and move on.

If you have troubles with English, it is okay. Stating that English is not your first language and that you have troubles with it won't cause harm and will avoid any confusions.

I have stated above that asking for help is OK, but this does not mean that you should rely on others only. Please make "Google Search" a regular habit and try to do some digging yourself and then ask for help. Do mention what you found so that others know that you do your homework before asking for help. This will put you in a positive light and also inculcate a great habit of solving problems yourself first.


## The Proposal

Organisations release a list of projects which one may perform for GSoC. They also state that one may come up with an idea of their own. This is something you should research and discuss very well with your mentors and make sure the idea is feasible. Generally, choosing from the pre-listed projects and making small tweaks in them is a great way to go. In any case, please discuss the project with your mentors and others contributors.

To start writing the proposal, look at what your seniors and previous year's GSoC student in your org did. SDSLabs has a [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0T_SihqkOFos_wMmcaRLzO48de9RxmgkMp-fEv3y1s/htmlview) which contains proposals of people selected from IITR each year. You will be able to figure out how to write your own proposal. Make sure your proposal is well-reviewed by your mentors and others.

Even though there is no compulsion of contributing in the "Community Bonding Period", it will be better to do so and hence tailor your proposal accordingly.

## Shortlised, now what?

Great job! Get ready for some good money and respect from your friends. Do not screw up the GSoC period if you want the money and your name on the GSoC website. It will be a great journey ahead and you will learn a ton of new things in a small timeframe. Try making connections with fellow contirbutors (I became fine friends with another fellow Git GSoC'er, also with my mentors and a couple of contributors). It will be lovely if you keep contirbuting there even after GSoC and become a mentor for someone next year. People feel nice to see their students/mentees follow their footsteps and teachings.

---
The whole GSoC journey, starting from making your first contribution to passing your third evaluation is a special one, therefore try to make the most out of it. Please do not let anyone else determine your fate and just brush off any negative comments you might get. If you stop believing in yourself, it's all over. Do not give up.

I hope this guide helps you in some way or the other. Best of luck!
