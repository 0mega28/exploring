# exploring

A guide to exploring things in the field of Computer Science. This will help the newer generations in exploring Computer Science.

Kind of a definitive answer to the question, "What should we explore and how should we do it?!"

The guide is located in the 'guide.txt' file.

Also, when adding things, please keep the formatting consistent! It will be of great help to me! Keep the information added discrete and not too descriptive.
PS: Please suggest a more apt and crisp name for this repository and its description ;)
