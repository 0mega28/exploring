For on-campus interns, you work for about 2.5 months in the company which recruits you and try to contribute to their work and maybe even work on some new technologies. The companies coming for a recruitment drive range from established ones like Google, Microsoft, Adobe, Oracle to new-age startups. The recruitment drive not only sees tech companies but various banks and research organisations such as Goldman Sachs, Sprinklr, Société Générale, etc.

# How are interns hired?

Companies have various ways of hiring tailored to the requirements of the interns they want. Some recruit directly, based on the grades of the students, some host coding tests, some have a mixed bag of questions. I will try to be as unfiltered as possible with the things I state.

The general pattern is:

	1. A test which includes coding questions, aptitude, CS
	   questions, etc.
	2. Multiple interviews rounds depending on the company.

Since the pattern may change every year depending on the conditions, I will not mention it explicitly for each company. Though here are some trends related to a few companies:

	1. Google: Always shortlists for interviews via resume.
	   Your CG and competitive programming background will matter.
	   There is no point of any other achievements.

	2. Adobe: Has many of its divisions come to campus for recruitments.
	   It also reaches out to the top 5 students of CSE for a direct offer.
	   You can also give a test for it and get selected.
	
	3. Microsoft: Considered a relatively easy company to crack
	   as compared to the big guns which come in the first couple
	   of weeks.
	
	4. Companies which come in the later weeks (in the 3rd or 4th week
	   and after) have relatively easy coding questions and also focus
	   on the resume of the student. This does not mean that one should
	   expect easy coding questions from them. Another thing to note
	   is that their tests are not solely focused on coding but
	   also contain aptitude, math and CS questions.

Another reason why I did not get into the testing and interviewing experience of these companies is that they vary from year to year. For instance:  This year (2020), Adobe did not directly recruit the top 5 DRs. Microsoft placed minimum CG criterion of 8 (which was 7) hence made the recruitment process more challenging.

 I obviously cannot give you false hope by stating anything inaccurate so I will be brutally honest with the things I mention. One thing to keep in mind is that about 70% of the companies will have a CG criterion on them (generally 7; I have seen a few 6.5 and 8 as well), so be prepared for that. The exceptions to the CG criteria are Google, Amazon, Adobe, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs, to name a few.

Therefore, it is self-evident that you should try to improve your grades no matter what else you do apart from that. A CG is 7.5+ will make you eligible to sit in the tests for 80-85% of the companies. So you have two semesters to make things better.

But if you have a low-grade point, the other way you can compensate is by honing your competitive programming skills. However, remember that when your scores in a test tie with someone else, the tiebreaker will be the CG.

# How to prepare for interns?

ACM IITR provided with a great [list](ACM-IITR-intern.pdf) of resources which you can refer to here. Now that you have some help, you now need a roadmap for the preparation:

### When to start?

Starting as early as possible will increase the chances of getting a well-paying intern (good payment $\not\propto$ good work BTW, totally depends on the company). But since people have other engagements such as GSoC/Outreachy (I highly recommend these), projects, etc., starting a year before may not be possible.

Going by the experiences of my friends who now have great interns, the best time to start will be the end of the 3rd semester (*, i.e.*, after the end sems).

For those who have the above-mentioned engagements, you might need to work just a bit harder (or choose an org/project which has very little work). And most probably, you will not be able to start even after the midsems of 2-2 since that time is the peak for GSoC (you have to start writing your proposal at that time). So, if you plan on taking up a project or getting into these competitions, try to cover some ground when you are free, *, i.e.*, in the winter break after 2-1 end sems.

If for some reason, you did not start then, do not worry, the summer vacations after 2-2 will help you cover the lost ground though you will have to work quite hard for that.

### What to study?

The best places to prepare for interns are InterviewBit and GeeksforGeeks. I suggest you save LeetCode for the placements ;)

Start doing InterviewBit from topic 0: "Time Complexity" and keep going **sequentially**. Do **NOT** try to skip topics (something I tried to do and found no luck doing it). InterviewBit has a couple of broken and incomplete questions, so ignore them if you come across any. It will be tough, to begin with; the main problem you will face is that you will not be able to figure out how to come up with an approach for the question. You will be able to get that "feel" that this is how you want to approach but won't be able to come up with a concrete solution. That is OK; that is one thing you will face for quite a handful number of questions, and the only solution to this problem is practice. It is OK to look at the solution to the problem if you are stuck for 15-20 minutes or so. With time it will all start to click and become comfortable.

Apart from IB, this [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/must-do-coding-questions-for-companies-like-amazon-microsoft-adobe/) contains a significant number of HOTS (Higher Order Thinking Skills; I did not make this term up, learnt this in class 8th) questions. Try attempting them to know what's up.

### What if I started late and was not able to do much?

I know this situation very well. I too started very late (in the third/fourth week of the interns when every big one had recruited; I had some other plans and did not want to sit for on-campus interns). In such a situation, try to get a good grasp of these topics:

- Sorting techniques: Bubble, Quick, Insertion, Selection, Merge and Heap Sort.
- Tree traversals: BFS and DFS.
- Attempt at least one question from each bucket of the following topics:
	- Arrays
	- Strings
	- Trees
	- Maps
	- Hashing
	
	If time allows, then also try to attempt:
	- Two Pointers
	- Math

	And keep doing some questions from the link mentioned above. Since there is a time crunch, you cannot write the code for every problem, therefore think of the approach and cross-check it. You can do this even when doing any mundane activity such as having dinner.

### What if I did all of the above and have nothing to do?

If you reach this stage, then it is great! But, do not ease out in such a case else your skill to solve questions will start to diminish. In such a case, try doing the "Medium" and "Hard" questions from LeetCode of the topics you like. Do the [puzzles](https://www.interviewbit.com/puzzles/) section of IB, or from [GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzles/). This will keep you entertained. If your thirst still isn't satisfied, then take part in CodeChef contests.

### Any other thing to keep in mind?

Even if you are not well versed with the coding part, and have not done much yet appear for an interview or are giving a test, be as cool-minded as possible. Do not think of the result or panic if you do not understand anything. Try re-reading the questions and solve them at a slow pace. Even if you might not get shortlisted, you still will gain some experience.

Now a couple of things specific to tests and interviews.

#### Tests

There is a high chance that the questions will repeat, *, i.e.*, you may encounter a problem from IB, LC or GFG. Therefore, the approaches should be on your tips. I am not asking you to memorise questions, but some questions have unique approaches which one may not be able to come up with on the spot (for instance Longest Palindromic Substring in [`O(n)`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kmp-algorithm-for-pattern-searching/)).  Try revising the approaches of some pet questions such as 0/1 Knapsack, LPS, print left side of tree etc. It will save you some time in the exam. The thing is that many questions are based on the fundamental questions only and use approaches very similar to these questions.

#### Interviews

I cannot stress enough number of times that you have to stay calm during an interview. Do **NOT** try to break the ice with the interviewer, let him do so. Follow the lead of the interviewer and reciprocate the energy he is giving away. Do **NOT** be very frank with him if he is reserved, it may come off as rude and overconfident.

Go in with the mindset that many companies are coming ahead and not securing an intern in this company won't cause harm. Some good soft skills go a long way, trust me when I say this. Also, try to have a good resume and be well versed with the achievements/projects/PORs you state in the resume. A good resume will make you stand out among a herd of other candidates. I mean, you came to college to learn a lot of things (not limited just to your degree) and your work in these four years will determine the start of your career and maybe even help you get a headstart over others.

---
I feel that I have mentioned plenty of things now and I am intentionally avoiding some stuff since that kind of things one should experience to learn better ;)

On an ending note, please maintain good spirits with your friends and maintain a healthy competition instead of trying to bring each other down. Even a little bit of support goes a long way and leads to great friendships and life satisfaction. I cannot credit my friends enough for helping me through these tough times, knowing that I started stuff late due to my own mistakes and helping me despite having their recruits to look after. Many of the tips I have written above are bits of advice from my good friends.

I hope now you get the idea of how things will be. Best of luck! I hope this helps you in some way or the other.
